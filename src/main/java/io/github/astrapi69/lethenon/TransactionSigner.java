/**
 * Signs a transfer, and checks a signed one.
 * <p>
 * Everything cryptographic here comes from this family's own library - {@code Signatures} out of
 * mystic-crypt 13.1, which dispatches by the suite identifier - rather than from the platform
 * directly. The chain
 * is the library's acceptance test (issue #1): primitives that cannot carry a chain are not
 * primitives, and reaching past them into {@code java.security} would mean never finding that out.
 * The gap this project reported when it had to write that switch itself is closed: mystic-crypt#149
 * added {@code Signatures}, and this class now asks it rather than deciding per scheme. An unknown
 * identifier is refused there with an exception rather than answered with a false that would read
 * as an invalid signature.
 * <p>
 * This class writes no primitive either way, only the rules around one - what gets signed, which
 * suite is named in it, and whose key has to match.
