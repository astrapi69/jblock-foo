/**
 * The peers a node was given on its command line, and when each is dialled again (#128).
 * <p>
 * Monero keeps its configured peers apart from the ones it learns and keeps reconnecting to them
 * from its idle loop; a peer given with {@code --peer} is the same here: one that could not be
 * reached, or whose connection ended, is dialled again while it is not connected. The pause before
 * the next attempt doubles with every attempt that fails, from {@link #FIRST} up to
 * {@link #LONGEST}, so that a peer that is down for an hour costs a dial every five minutes rather
 * than one every few seconds, and a connection that ends after a handshake is dialled again after
 * the first pause.
