/**
 * A block before it was mined: everything that has to be fixed before anybody looks for a pun.
 *
 * @param chainIdentifier
 *            the chain this belongs to, inside the hash like everywhere else
 * @param height
 *            how many blocks precede this one; the genesis block is zero
 * @param previousHash
 *            the hash of the block before, which is what makes this a chain
 * @param beneficiary
 *            the account this block pays: at height 0 the holder of the non-pool half of the
 *            supply, at every later height the miner who receives the reward. It is inside the
 *            hash, so it cannot be changed without mining the block again - the chain says who was
 *            paid, not whoever replays it (lethenon#23)
 * @param transactions
 *            the signed transfers this block carries, in the order they are applied
 * @param timestamp
 *            when the block was made, as milliseconds since the epoch - a parameter rather than a
 *            clock reading, so that a third party can recompute the hash
 * @param difficulty
 *            how many leading zero BITS the block hash needs, which is what mining looks for
 * @param pun
 *            the miner's wordplay. It is what varies while mining, instead of a numeric nonce, and
 *            it is covered by the hash like everything else - otherwise mining it would prove
 *            nothing
