/**
 * The command line of the chain (lethenon#2, milestone 4).

 * Everything works on two kinds of file: the chain file, which anybody can replay, and a wallet
 * file, which only its password opens. There is no server and no network here: a balance is
 * computed from the chain file, never asked of anybody.
 * <p>
 * A password is never an argument - an argument list is visible to every process on the machine.
 * It is read from the first line of standard input.
 * <p>
 * Exit codes: 0 done; 1 refused, with the reason on standard error - a chain that does not
 * verify, a wrong password, a transfer the account cannot cover; 2 a command line that was not
 * understood.
