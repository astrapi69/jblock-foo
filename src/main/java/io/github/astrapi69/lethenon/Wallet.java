/**
 * A wallet that can be recovered: 32 bytes of entropy, every key derived from them, and two ways
 * back - the 24 words of its {@link SeedPhrase BIP-39 phrase}, or enough Shamir shares of the
 * entropy (lethenon#2, milestone 4). Both reach the same wallet: the shares split the entropy, and
 * the entropy is what the words encode.
 * <p>
 * The keys are never stored on their own. The phrase is stretched into the 64 byte BIP-39 seed,
 * with an empty passphrase, and each key is a path below that seed, after SLIP-0010:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ed25519 tree     m/1984'/0'/0'   the Ed25519 spend key
 * curve25519 tree  m/1984'/0'/1'   the X25519 view key of the published address
 * ed25519 tree     m/1984'/0'/2'   the seed xi of the ML-DSA-65 spend key
 * </pre>
 *
 * 1984 is this chain's purpose number, the 0 after it the account. SLIP-0010 knows nothing of
 * ML-DSA; its 32 byte seed is taken from a branch of the ed25519 tree, which gives 32 bytes that
 * nothing else uses, and FIPS 204 makes the key pair from them. These paths are a recovery format:
 * once a wallet exists, changing one makes its keys unreachable from its own backup.
 * <p>
 * The backup is {@link SecretSharing} from mystic-crypt - Shamir over the entropy, with every share
 * knowing its split and its threshold, so shares of two different wallets or too few of them are
 * refused instead of combining into wrong entropy and a wallet that is silently somebody else's.
