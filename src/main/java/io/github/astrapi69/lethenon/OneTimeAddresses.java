/**
 * Payments that cannot be linked to the address they were sent to, and can still be spent.
 * <p>
 * The sender takes the recipient's published view key, makes a key pair for this payment alone,
 * derives a shared secret with X25519, and hashes it into a tweak. The destination is the
 * recipient's spend key blinded with that tweak - the one-time public key {@code P = S + H(s)*B},
 * a real Ed25519 public key. Two payments to the same published address therefore land on keys with
 * nothing visibly in common, the recipient recognises both with its view private key alone, and it
 * can MOVE them, because the blinded scalar {@code b + H(s) mod l} is a private key only the holder
 * of the spend key can compute (#21).
 * <p>
 * The view tag is one byte of the same secret, carried in the clear. It is a filter, not a secret:
 * a wallet can rule out 255 of every 256 transactions with one comparison instead of a full
 * derivation, which is what makes scanning a whole chain affordable on a laptop.
 * <p>
 * Nothing here is curve arithmetic. The X25519 agreement is mystic-crypt's
 * {@link X25519KeyExchange}, which runs the raw secret through HKDF; the blinding is its
 * {@link Ed25519KeyBlinding}, the deliberate exception decided in #21 and built there rather than
 * in this project. What this class defines is the rule: what is hashed, in which order, with which
 * domain tag.
