/**
 * What a wallet owns, worked out from the chain it holds and nothing else.
 * <p>
 * A wallet that asks a server for its balance tells that server which addresses belong to one
 * person, from which network address, and when - every time it is opened. That single message
 * undoes what one-time destinations are for, which is why milestone 3 asks for a balance that is
 * computed rather than requested (lethenon#2): the wallet replays the chain, recognises its own
 * destinations with the view private key, and reads the amounts out of the state its own replay
 * produced.
 * <p>
 * The balance is therefore a VERIFIED balance. A chain that does not replay has no balance at all
 * here - {@link Replay} throws and this method does not catch it - because a number taken from
 * unverified blocks is exactly the number a server would have been trusted for.
 * <p>
 * The spending key is not a parameter. Recognising payments needs the view private key alone, so a
 * scan can run where the key that moves money never goes.
 *
 * @param received
 *            the payments that belong to this address, in the order the chain carries them
 * @param balance
 *            the sum the replayed state holds at those destinations
 * @param blocksRead
 *            how many blocks were replayed and scanned
 * @param transactionsRead
 *            how many transfers were looked at, ours and everybody else's
