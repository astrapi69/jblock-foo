 * A transfer, before anybody signed it.

 * from being replayed on another one.

 * @param sender
 *            the sender's public key
 * @param recipient
 *            where the transfer goes: a destination with its scheme, key, ephemeral key and view
 *            tag, one-time when the scheme is

 * @param fee
 *            what the miner keeps
 * @param memo
 *            the text that is signed with the transfer - the protest is inside the chain, not
