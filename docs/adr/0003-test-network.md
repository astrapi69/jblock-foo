# ADR 0003: A network for the test chain

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-10-07
- Released by the maintainer (#76); every choice below was made within that release, by best
  practice and the recommendations recorded here, without a further question to the maintainer

## Context

Until now a chain lives in one file on one machine: `mine` appends a block, `send` and `faucet`
append to `<chain>.pending`, and nobody else learns of either. For a chain to be a chain, nodes
have to relay blocks and transfers, a new node has to catch up with every block checked, two nodes
that mined at the same height have to agree on one chain, and a transfer must not be spendable
twice while it waits.

### What the repository already has

Inventory of develop at 6f637a3:

- **Encoding.** `CanonicalEncoding` encodes a signed transfer (`encode(SignedTransaction)`,
  `readSignedTransaction`) and a chain (`encodeChain`, `readChain`), each with its version byte. A
  single block travels as a chain of one, so the network needs no new block format.
- **Verification.** `Replay.verify(chain)` checks every hash, signature, nonce, balance, difficulty,
  timestamp rule, chain identifier and the supply after every block. It is the only verifier, and
  the network uses nothing else.
- **Difficulty.** `DifficultyRule` gives a block's difficulty in leading zero bits, from 8 to 256,
  so a block's work is 2^difficulty.
- **Persistence.** `ChainFile` writes the chain and `<chain>.pending` atomically (write and rename).
- **Isolation.** `NoBalanceQueryTest` keeps the chain package unable to name a networking type, and
  already names `lethenon.transport` as the place a transport belongs.

### Monero as the blueprint

Read from the Monero sources, commit f6a591c (2026-10-04), `git clone --depth 1 --sparse`:

- **Handshake.** It carries a `network_id` (`src/p2p/p2p_protocol_defs.h:151`) and the peer's
  `current_height`, `cumulative_difficulty` and `top_id`
  (`src/cryptonote_protocol/cryptonote_protocol_defs.h:254-257`).
- **Messages.**
  - Relaying: `NOTIFY_NEW_BLOCK`, `NOTIFY_NEW_TRANSACTIONS`.
  - Chain sync: `NOTIFY_REQUEST_CHAIN`, `NOTIFY_RESPONSE_CHAIN_ENTRY`.
  - Fetching blocks: `NOTIFY_REQUEST_GET_OBJECTS`, `NOTIFY_RESPONSE_GET_OBJECTS`.
  - All in `cryptonote_protocol_defs.h:174-291`.
- **Locator for the chain request.** "IDs of the first 10 blocks are sequential, next goes with
  pow(2,n) offset ... and the last one is always genesis block" (`cryptonote_protocol_defs.h:280`).
  The answer carries `start_height`, `total_height` and the block ids (`:297-301`).
- **Limits.**
  - `P2P_DEFAULT_CONNECTIONS_COUNT 12` (`src/cryptonote_config.h:141`).
  - `P2P_DEFAULT_PACKET_MAX_SIZE 50000000` (`:143`).
  - `P2P_DEFAULT_HANDSHAKE_INVOKE_TIMEOUT 5000` ms (`:150`).
  - `P2P_DEFAULT_INVOKE_TIMEOUT` two minutes (`:149`).
  - `BLOCKS_SYNCHRONIZING_DEFAULT_COUNT 20` blocks per request (`:98`).

## Decision

### Where the code lives

- **Package.** The network is the package `io.github.astrapi69.lethenon.transport`. The chain package
  does not name it, and `NoBalanceQueryTest` keeps it that way.
- **What stays in the chain package.** The logic that decides about blocks and transfers - the
  pool of waiting transfers, fork choice, cumulative work - stays there, with no networking types,
  so it is testable without a socket.
- **Dependencies.** None new. Sockets from `java.net`, one virtual thread per connection, and a
  single lock around a node's chain and pool.

### Only the test chain

A node runs only on `lethenon-test-2`.
- It refuses a chain file whose genesis block names `lethenon-2`.
- It refuses a chain file under `lethenon-test-1` or `lethenon-1` with the reason that the chain was
  started before the rules of 0.3.0 (#137).
- It creates no main chain.
- Its handshake refuses any peer that names another chain or another genesis block.

The main chain gets a network only by a later decision. This ADR binds nothing on the main chain
to an external review, because it puts nothing there.

### Frames and messages

Each message is one frame on the stream: a 4-byte length, a 1-byte message type, the payload. The
length counts the type and the payload and is checked before anything is allocated.

| Message | Payload | Monero counterpart |
|---|---|---|
| `HELLO` | magic "LETHENON", protocol version, chain identifier, genesis hash, best height, best hash, cumulative work, listening port (0 for none), node identity | handshake with `network_id`, `my_port`, `peer_id` and core sync data |
| `BLOCK` | one block, encoded as a chain of one | `NOTIFY_NEW_BLOCK` |
| `TRANSFER` | one signed transfer | `NOTIFY_NEW_TRANSACTIONS` |
| `GET_CHAIN` | a locator of block hashes, built as Monero's | `NOTIFY_REQUEST_CHAIN` |
| `CHAIN` | the height of the first hash the peer shares, then the hashes after it | `NOTIFY_RESPONSE_CHAIN_ENTRY` |
| `GET_BLOCKS` | first height, count | `NOTIFY_REQUEST_GET_OBJECTS` |
| `BLOCKS` | the blocks, encoded as a chain | `NOTIFY_RESPONSE_GET_OBJECTS` |
| `GET_PEERS` | nothing | the peer list in Monero's handshake answer |
| `PEERS` | at most 250 addresses, host and port | `local_peerlist_new` |

There is deliberately no message that asks for a balance, an account or an address. A node serves
blocks and transfers; a wallet computes its balance from the chain, as before.

### Handshake

Both sides send `HELLO` first and read the other's within the handshake timeout. The connection is
closed, with the reason logged, when any of these hold:
- the magic is wrong;
- the protocol version is not this build's;
- the chain identifier is not `lethenon-test-2`;
- the genesis hash differs;
- the node identity is this node's own: the connection leads back to itself.

A peer with more cumulative work is asked for its chain at once.

### Peer exchange (#102)

Protocol version 2 adds two fields to `HELLO`, as Monero's handshake carries them
(`basic_node_data`, `src/p2p/p2p_protocol_defs.h:152-155`):
- the port the node listens on, 0 for a caller that does not listen;
- a random identity the node draws at start, so that a connection to itself is recognised.

A version-1 peer is refused like any other version.

How addresses travel:
- After the handshake, a node asks a listening peer with `GET_PEERS`. The answer `PEERS` carries at
  most 250 addresses (`P2P_DEFAULT_PEERS_IN_HANDSHAKE 250`, `src/cryptonote_config.h:144`). A
  `PEERS` that was not asked for disconnects.
- A node keeps Monero's two lists: addresses it has itself been connected to, at most 1,000
  (`P2P_LOCAL_WHITE_PEERLIST_LIMIT`, `:138`), and addresses only heard of, at most 5,000
  (`P2P_LOCAL_GRAY_PEERLIST_LIMIT`, `:139`).
- Only the first list is passed on, the newest 250. An address heard of becomes confirmed when a
  connection to it succeeds, and is forgotten when one fails. An address that leads back to the
  node itself is never dialled again.
- While a node has room for outgoing connections, at most 12, it dials addresses from the lists.
  `--no-discovery` (`Node.discoverPeers(false)`) keeps it with the peers it was given, and it
  still answers `GET_PEERS`.

What is never passed on:
- A caller that does not listen announces port 0 and is never named to anybody: `send --node`,
  a node taking its genesis block. A node does not ask such a caller for addresses either.
- An accepted peer is passed on as its host and the port it announced, never as the ephemeral
  port of the connection.

This makes a listening node's address known to every node it meets, which is what a network
needs and what a protest chain should say plainly: running a node that listens publishes its
address. Tor is the later step that changes that.

### Relaying and missing blocks

- **A new block.** A node that mines or accepts a block sends it as `BLOCK` to every peer except the
  one it came from.
- **A new transfer.** A node that admits a transfer to its pool sends it as `TRANSFER` the same way.
- **An unknown parent.** A received block whose parent the node does not know is not a fault: the
  node sends `GET_CHAIN` to that peer and synchronises.

Frames to a peer are written by a thread of that peer's own, from a bounded queue. A node handles a
frame on the thread that read it, and that thread may have to send to other peers; writing to their
sockets directly could leave two nodes that relay to each other waiting for each other to read
(#82).

Full blocks are relayed, not Monero's compact "fluffy" blocks. Blocks here are small, and that
optimisation can come later.

### Synchronisation

1. `GET_CHAIN` carries the locator.
2. The peer answers `CHAIN` with the height of the newest locator hash it shares and up to 500
   following hashes.
3. The node then fetches the blocks in `GET_BLOCKS` batches of at most 20 (Monero's default).
4. It builds the candidate chain: its own blocks up to the shared height, then the fetched ones.
5. It checks the whole candidate with `Replay.verify`.

A candidate that does not verify is dropped and the peer disconnected. Replaying the whole chain
for each batch is linear in its length, which is fine for a test chain; an incremental replay is
a later optimisation.

### Forks: the most work wins

- **Work.** The cumulative work of a chain is the sum of 2^difficulty over its blocks, as a
  BigInteger.
- **Switching.** A node switches to a verified candidate only if its work is strictly greater than
  that of its own chain. On equal work it keeps the chain it had, the first seen.
- **Rolling back.** Switching drops the node's blocks above the fork point. Their transfers go back
  into the pool if they are still valid on the new chain; the rest are dropped.
- **Depth.** The blocks of a fork are held until the fork carries more work. A fork is followed
  only if it overtakes within one `CHAIN` answer, 500 blocks after the fork point; a deeper one is
  recorded and not followed. That bounds what a peer can make a node hold, and it is in effect a
  limit on how deep a reorganisation can be. Lifting it needs a fetch across several `CHAIN`
  answers that keeps the held blocks bounded some other way (#88).

### The pool of waiting transfers

`TransactionPool`, in the chain package, admits a transfer only if:
- its chain identifier and schemes are admitted (`ConsensusRules`);
- its signature verifies;
- its nonce is exactly the sender's next one, counting the transfers of that sender already in the
  pool;
- the sender's balance covers it after them.

A second transfer from the same sender with the same nonce is a double spend. It is refused, and
the first one seen stays: there is no replacement by fee. After each new tip the pool drops what
the block carried and re-checks the rest.

Admission keeps, per sender, how many transfers wait and what they spend, and checks a new one
against that; each signature is checked once, when its transfer is offered. Re-applying a sender's
waiting transfers on every offer took about 12.5 million signature checks to fill the pool from one
sender (#92).

Transfers to a sender that are still waiting do not count towards its balance, the same as
`Transfers.prepare`: then a sender's waiting transfers are valid in any block that carries them in
their order, whatever else the block carries (#82).

A node keeps its chain in `<chain>` and its pool in `<chain>.pending`, in the existing formats, so
`balance` and the other readers keep working on a node's files. At start it offers every waiting
transfer to the pool again, so a double spend or a transfer that no longer fits is dropped there
and the file rewritten (#90).

`send` and `faucet` hand a transfer to a running node with `--node host:port` instead of writing
the file (#90):
- The transfer is prepared against the chain and pool in the file named by `--chain`, which has to
  be the file the node serves.
- The handover is a handshake, one `TRANSFER` frame, then the command closes its direction and reads
  until the node closes the other. A node handles frames in order, so it has then admitted or
  refused the transfer.
- The command then reads the node's pool file. If the transfer is not there, it fails with a
  message. A node on another machine or another file keeps a pool the command cannot see, and that
  case fails closed rather than reporting a success it could not check.

A file a node serves belongs to the node while it runs. `mine` and `sweep` on it would be
overwritten by the node's next write; mining on a node is `node --mine`.

### Limits

| Limit | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| frame size | 4 MiB | below Monero's 50,000,000 bytes; the largest message here is `BLOCKS` |
| outgoing connections | the configured peers, at most 12 | Monero's default of 12 |
| incoming connections | at most 16 | own choice; refused above it |
| handshake timeout | 5 s | Monero's 5000 ms |
| answer timeout | 120 s | Monero's two-minute invoke timeout (`P2P_DEFAULT_INVOKE_TIMEOUT`, `src/cryptonote_config.h:149`): a peer that does not answer a `GET_CHAIN` or `GET_BLOCKS` in time is disconnected; one with nothing asked of it may stay quiet (#92) |
| blocks per `GET_BLOCKS` | at most 20, and an answer carries only as many as fit in one frame | Monero's default; the asker takes fewer and asks for the rest (#98) |
| hashes per `CHAIN` | at most 500 | own choice |
| pool size | at most 5,000 transfers | own choice; refused above it |
| frames waiting for one peer | at most 1,024 | own choice; a peer that does not read them is disconnected (#82) |
| block size | at most 300,000 bytes, a consensus rule on the test chain | Monero's `CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE_V5`, `src/cryptonote_config.h:60`, taken as a hard limit (#99). Measured: an Ed25519 transfer is 199 bytes, an ML-DSA-65 transfer 5,376, so a block holds about 55 ML-DSA-65 transfers. The former cap of 500 transfers per mined block made a block of 500 ML-DSA-65 transfers 2,692,122 bytes, and two of them no longer fit in a frame (#98) |

A peer that sends a frame above the limit, an unknown message type, bytes that do not decode, or a
block that does not verify is disconnected.

### A genesis block fixed in the code (#104)

The mechanism a main chain needs, built and tested on the test chain; the main chain's block itself
is the maintainer's decision, above all the allocation it carries.

- `ConsensusRules` carries an anchor table: per chain at most one genesis block, as its canonical
  bytes (`GenesisAnchor`). Monero fixes its genesis the same way, `GENESIS_TX` and `GENESIS_NONCE`
  (`src/cryptonote_config.h:239-240`).
- An anchor is checked when the table is built: exactly one block, at height 0, of the chain it is
  filed under, verifying on its own. A table that fails this is not built.
- `Replay` rejects a chain whose genesis block is not its chain's anchor, naming both hashes.
- `Genesis.start` gives the anchor for an anchored chain and mines a new genesis block otherwise;
  `mine` and `node` start chains through it. A node with an empty file on an anchored chain starts
  from the anchor, with no trust in a peer for its first block.
- `lethenon genesis [--testnet] --wallet <file>` mines a candidate, prints its hash and canonical
  bytes, and writes nothing.
- `ConsensusRules.LETHENON` carries no anchor for either chain.


### The node command

`lethenon node --chain <file> --listen <port> [--peer host:port ...] [--mine --wallet <file>] [--for <seconds>]`
- It serves the chain file and relays.
- With `--mine` it mines on its pool and pays the wallet. If the chain file is empty, it starts a
  test chain, which is the same as `mine --testnet`. A block carries the longest prefix of the
  waiting transfers that fits the block size limit (#99). Mining runs in rounds of 100,000
  attempts; between rounds the node looks at its tip, so a block from a peer stops work on a tip
  that is no longer the tip (#94).
- Without `--mine`, a node with an empty chain file takes the genesis block from the first
  configured peer that answers, then synchronises.
  - It reads the peer's HELLO, shakes hands on the genesis hash announced there, asks for block 0,
    and checks that the block hashes to that announcement, is a test-chain genesis block, and
    verifies.
  - This is trust on first use. The peers are a fixed list the operator chose, and it is a test
    chain. Everything after the genesis block is verified as on any node. A node that should not
    trust its peers for the genesis block starts from a chain file that has it (#94).
- `--for` stops it after that many seconds; without it, it runs until interrupted.

### A sync that stops (#107)

`lethenon sync --chain <file> --peer host:port [--within <seconds>]`, and `Sync.once` in the
library, bring a chain file up to one node's tip and stop. Between copying a file and running a
node, this is what a wallet, a script or the desktop plugin needs.

- It runs a node in memory that neither listens nor discovers peers, connects it to the one peer,
  and synchronises as above. Every block is verified by the same replay.
- It stops when its chain holds the tip the peer announced in its HELLO, or carries at least the
  work the peer announced. A file ahead of the peer is left as it is.
- The chain file is written once, at the end, and only when the chain grew. A sync that fails
  writes nothing: the peer cannot be reached, refuses the handshake, breaks off, or has not handed
  over its tip within the time (default 300 s). The pending file is not touched.
- An empty file starts as a node's does, from the anchor fixed in the code or, without one, from
  the peer's genesis block (trust on first use).
- It reads no wallet and asks for nothing but the chain. A balance is still computed from the file.

## Toward a main chain

The prerequisites are built and tested on the test chain. For the main chain they wait on
decisions, not on code:

| Prerequisite | State on `lethenon-test-2` | What the main chain needs |
|---|---|---|
| bound on future timestamps | two hours, from height 0 (#96) | done: two hours on the main chain too, from height 0 (#109) |
| block size limit | 300,000 bytes, from height 0 (#99) | done: 300,000 bytes on the main chain too, from height 0 (#109) |
| peer exchange | protocol version 2 (#102) | nothing chain-specific; a node still runs only on the test chain |
| genesis block in the code | the mechanism, no anchor (#104) | the block: its beneficiary and its message, decided by the maintainer, mined with the integration build and filed as a `GenesisAnchor` under `lethenon-2` (#137) |
| a chain identifier of the rules from 0.3.0 on | `lethenon-test-2`; `lethenon-test-1` refused as started before those rules (#137) | `lethenon-2`; `lethenon-1` refused the same way, so no version computes another chain's balances without a word (#137) |

The limits apply to the main chain from height 0 since #109. For main chains mined before, the
timestamp bound changes nothing, because the clock only moves on. The size limit rejects a main
chain that carries a block over 300,000 bytes: lethenon 0.2.0 mined without a byte cap, so that is
a block with 56 or more ML-DSA-65 transfers, or 1,515 or more Ed25519 transfers, paying an Ed25519
miner (5,375 and 198 bytes per transfer, 201 bytes for the block around them with the mining
suffix, measured for #109).
Whether existing main-chain files are kept at all depends on the anchor: once one is filed, a main
chain that starts elsewhere does not verify. A node on the main chain is a further decision, and
Tor comes before it.

## Consequences

- The chain package stays unable to reach a network. Everything that talks lives in `transport`.
- A wallet asks no node for its balance. There is no message to do so.
- **Block size is bounded on the test chain (#99).** A block larger than 300,000 bytes, as
  `CanonicalEncoding.blockSize` counts it, does not verify. Monero has no fixed maximum; it uses a
  block weight median and a reward penalty above its full reward zone of 300,000 bytes. lethenon
  pays its reward from a pre-minted pool and has no penalty for a dynamic scheme to act on, so
  Monero's baseline is taken as a hard limit. Mining carries the longest prefix of the waiting
  transfers that fits, and `mine` keeps the rest waiting. The main chain has the same limit since
  #109.
- **Future timestamps are bounded on the test chain (#96).** A block whose timestamp lies more than
  two hours after the verifying node's clock does not verify. This is Monero's
  `CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_FUTURE_TIME_LIMIT 60*60*2` (`src/cryptonote_config.h:47`), checked against the
  local clock as Monero does in `Blockchain::check_block_timestamp`
  (`src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp:3813`), at the same two-minute target block time. The
  rule lives in `ConsensusRules` as the chain's `BlockLimits` and is checked by `Replay`. The
  clock only moves on, so a chain that verified once keeps verifying. The main chain has the same
  bound since #109.
- **A reorganisation is at most one `CHAIN` answer deep.** A heavier fork whose advantage only
  shows after more than 500 blocks is not followed, and two nodes on such forks stay apart. On a
  test chain that is a choice; it is not one for a chain with value (#88).
- **Peer exchange without Tor.** Addresses travel in the clear and name the hosts of listening
  nodes (#102). Tor comes later as a transport.
